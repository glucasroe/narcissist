# Narcissist
## A simple theme for my portfolio site. All dirty laundry aired on Github.

This is meant to be a theme for Ghost, but that may change as I figure out the complexities of theming it.

##To Do:
* Work on featured images
* Featured images on Posts page?
* Auto load more posts when scrolled
* Make the favicon not look like a square pile of asses.
* Add a code colorizer, probably [SyntaxHighlighter](http://alexgorbatchev.com/SyntaxHighlighter/manual/configuration/)
* My fade in animation is broken again? :(
* Implement search with [GhostHunter](https://github.com/i11ume/ghostHunter)
* ~~Code Nested in pre vs code inline~~
* ~~Underline links A. La. [Medium](https://medium.com/designing-medium/crafting-link-underlines-on-medium-7c03a9274f9)~~
* ~~Find if there can be a category page?~~
* ~~Make a posts page.~~
* ~~**DID I ACTUALLY FORGET TO DO LISTS?!?**~~
* ~~Annotations?~~
* ~~Convert to an actual template, obvi.~~
* ~~Resume Page?~~
* ~~Figure out a better way to make the drop down menu. Right now, I don't care~~
