# Narcissist
## A simple theme for my portfolio site. All dirty laundry aired on Github.

This is meant to be a theme for Ghost, but that may change as I figure out the complexities of theming it.

##To Do:
* **DID I ACTUALLY FORGET TO DO LISTS?!?**
* Implement search with [GhostHunter](https://github.com/i11ume/ghostHunter)
* Make a posts page.
* Find if there can be a category page?
* Add a code colorizer, probably [SyntaxHighlighter](http://alexgorbatchev.com/SyntaxHighlighter/manual/configuration/)
* ~~Annotations?~~
* ~~Convert to an actual template, obvi.~~


##After Launch:
* Resume Page?
* My fade in animation is broken again? :(
* ~~Figure out a better way to make the drop down menu. Right now, I don't care~~
